## Philosophy

I’ve spent way too much time on customizing Obsidian, thousands of themes with millions of customizations, I believe a lot people do it too. It’s anti-productivity at this point, we need something that just works and is pleasant to use.

1. **Less plugins.** — Plugins are only used for disabling features and fixing issues instead of adding. Cupertino works perfectly out of the box.
2. **Less customizations** — Cupertino will never have customization. More customization make you waste more time on fiddling.
3. **Less visual noise** — Content is the key. Cupertino makes Obsidian blend in system style, so you can focus on what you're typing.

Cupertino is developed as I use Obsidian, while I'm trying to focus on being consistent, inconsistency happens. If you spot any, feel free to submit issues.
